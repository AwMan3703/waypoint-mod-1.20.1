# waypoint-mod-1.20.1
## Waypoint mod for Minecraft - v1.20.1 / Fabric / Server-side only - replit.com bounty for @DillonB07

### How to use:
- make sure to add `FW_Datapack.zip` to the server's datapacks folder (https://github.com/AwMan3703/waypoint-mod-1.20.1/src_DATAPACK/FW_Datapack.zip), in order for the /waypoint follow command to correctly display the HUD.
- `./gradlew build` to build the mod, then use the outputted .jar file as any other Fabric mod.
