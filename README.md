# waypoint-mod-1.20.1
## Waypoint mod for Minecraft - v1.20.1 / Fabric / Server-side only - replit.com bounty for @DillonB07

### How to use:
- make sure to place `FW_Datapack.zip` ([get it here](https://github.com/AwMan3703/waypoint-mod-1.20.1/tree/1ff7db74d322855f6e701c489e62244c71542272/src_DATAPACK)) in your server's datapacks folder **AND UNZIP IT** (this is needed for the /waypoint follow command to correctly display the HUD).
- `./gradlew build` to build the mod, then use the outputted .jar file as any other Fabric mod.
